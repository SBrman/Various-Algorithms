# Algorithms
This repo will be updated with various algorithms I implement in different languages.

# Currently contains:
## 1. Yen's Top k-shortest path algorithm (in Python):
Given, a weighted directed graph $G$, source and sink nodes, this algorithm determines the top $k$ shortest paths. This algorithm also requires one to one shortest path for different nodes. For those shortest paths Dijkstra's one to all shortest path algorithm is used here.

## 2. Karatsuba's Multiplication algorithm using divide and conquer (In C++, usable in Python):
Given, two large integer, using divide and conquer recursive approach multiplies the numbers. Time complexity is $O(n^{1.59})$ where the regular multiplication algorithm's time complexity is $O(n^2)$
