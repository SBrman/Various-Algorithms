# Algorithms
This repo will be updated with various algorithms I implement in different languages.

# Currently contains:
## 1. Yen's Top k-shortest path algorithm (in Python):
Given, a weighted directed graph $G$, source and sink nodes, this algorithm determines the top $k$ shortest paths. This algorithm also requires one to one shortest path for different nodes. For those shortest paths Dijkstra's one to all shortest path algorithm is used here.
